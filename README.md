# btrfs_exporter
A Btrfs filesystem metrics exporter for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).

Status (2018-11-14)
-------------------
This projects was just created and does **not** do anything useful yet!
I've removed the initial python bits since I decided to move to C++ and
use [prometheus-cpp](https://github.com/jupp0r/prometheus-cpp) instead.

For background see [this bug](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/issues/1100).
